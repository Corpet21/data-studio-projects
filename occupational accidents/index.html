      <p class="body-text serif">882.730 workers stayed home recovering from an injury or illness in 2017 in the U.S., according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. All of them were -at the moment- working for the private sector.</p>
      <p class="body-text serif">The wholesale trade industry appears to be the industry where a non-fatal injury is more likely to happen. There are nearly 15 events every 1.000 people working for the industry. The Transportation and Warehouse Industry comes second with almost 13 accidents happening every 1000 workers. On the contrary, Finance and Insurance and Educational services appear to be safer workplaces.</p>

        <h3 class="section-head serif">White Vs Non-White workers</h3>
        <p class="body-text serif">The data also showed that Non-White people well incredibly much more likely to get injured while working. In particular, 120 per 1000 Non-white people experienced an occupational accident during 2017. That was definitely not the case for White people, since only 20 per 1000 workers suffer the same fate. </p>

      <h3 class="section-head serif">The racial breakdown</h3>
      <p class="body-text serif">The Wholesale Trade industry, as mentioned before, is certainly the most dangerous one when it comes to 
        non-fatal occupational accidents. But it's not equally dangerous for everyone. Black and Hispanic/Latino people tend to get more frequently injured, as highlighted in the graph below. More than 15 per 1000 Black and 1000 Hispanic/Latino people working for the Wholesale Trade Industry got hurt in 2017. The numbers are alarming for the Hispanic/Latino people working in Construction as well. On the contrary, White and Asian workers seem to be generally less vulnerable to workplace injuries.

      <h3 class="section-head serif">Intentional VS Non-Intentional Injuries</h3>
      <p class="body-text serif">According to data, Hispanic or Latino people were more frequently involved in a non-intentional 
        accident in 2017. That means that the injury was not a result of another person's aggression. Asians were injured the least.On the other hand, Black workers were the most common target of attacks and assaults in 2017.And hitting, kicking, beating, shoving were the most common ways that they got attacked.</p>
