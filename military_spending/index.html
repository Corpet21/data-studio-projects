      <p class="body-text serif">It had been only a month since the inauguration ceremony, when Donald Trump proposed a $54 billion increase in military spending, in February 2017. He was wearing a red tie and an American flag pin when he argued that this 10% increase would help "rebuild the depleted military of the United States of America".
      </p>
      <p class="body-text serif">The U.S. military was far from depleted, though. In fact, according to the New York Times, the United States had, at the time, the third larger army in the world (after India and China) and a "global presence like no other nation". The defense budget was eventually increased by 32 billion dollars that year.

            <div class="story-body">
            <p class="body-text serif">U.S. military spending has been steadily increasing over the past seventy years. Until the mid-'70s, there's a subtle but present budget increase every time the United States engaged in a war (Korean War, Vietnam war). Although, until then, the budget did not exceed 100 billion dollars. There is an unprecedented rise in spending the following years, starting from the last quarter of the '70s. In a 15-year-term, until the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, military spending will rise to 400 billion dollars. 
              </p>
      
          <p class="body-text serif">However, the defense budget skyrocketed after the 9/11 terrorist attack and the ensuing counter-terrorism policy that was predominantly undertaken by the Bush administration. When Obama took office, in 2009, the military expenditures had already exceeded 700 billion dollars.

                <p class="body-text serif">US spending consists of discretionary and mandatory spending. Discretionary spending refers to the optional part of fiscal policy, it's defined by members of Congress each year and it funds defense and non-defense programs. Education, foreign aid and transportation belong to the latter.</p>
                <p class="body-text serif">Defense spending usually outweighs non-defense, as shown in the graph below. This trend is particularly clear during the '60s and the '80s.</p>
